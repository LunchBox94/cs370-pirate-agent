CS 370 Module Eight Portfolio Submission – Pirate Intelligent Agent


Brief Explanation of the Project Work


For this project, I was provided with a framework for building an intelligent agent using reinforcement learning in a pirate-themed grid environment. The starter code included a basic environment setup, agent movement rules, and reward structure. I expanded on this by implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train the agent to learn optimal actions. I coded the neural network model, training loop, and performance evaluation. I also adjusted hyperparameters, added experience replay, and implemented epsilon-greedy exploration to improve learning efficiency.

Reflection

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing efficient algorithms, building systems, and creating applications that improve everyday life. From AI-powered assistants to automated logistics and healthcare tools, the work of computer scientists touches nearly every aspect of modern society. Their innovations shape how we communicate, work, and interact with technology.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I now approach problems by breaking them into smaller components, analyzing the requirements, and identifying the best tools or algorithms to solve them. In this course, I learned to experiment, evaluate results, and iterate systematically especially through debugging and improving my reinforcement learning model.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, I must ensure that the systems I build are secure, fair, and respectful of user privacy. In AI specifically, it’s crucial to avoid bias, maintain transparency, and ensure models are tested thoroughly to prevent harm. My responsibility extends beyond functionality I must also prioritize ethical design, especially in data collection and decision-making processes.
